Grocery-based product delivery is becoming more popular and wide area of interest. The goal of this website is to cut out the middleman and reward hardworking farmers. The motto of this website is to identify factors that influence buying intent. Young farmers are encouraged to sell large quantities of products such as vegetables, fruits, milk, grains, and so on... It is only accessible to farmers who have a farmer's ID and verification is done through OTP to specified farmer phone number. To enhance purchase intent, grocery-based product delivery marketplaces
must improve user satisfaction, provide more benefits to customers, and maintain a continuous loyalty programme.

The website can be accessed only by the unique farmer id of the farmers to completely eradicate illegal activities. So, coming to the point, this idea might also help the farmers to overcome poverty and get a better livelihood by getting good rates from sale of products.

Farmers are having severe financial problems as a result of the rapid advancement of technology.Technology is developed to make work easier rather than to provide a convenient profit to those who farm. As a result, we design technologies to assist farmers in obtaining a profit.

their Farmer ID and can be accessed if authentication method is verified. OTP is used as a way of authentication (One Time Password).As each Farmer ID is unique, it compares it to the data in each field and only allows access to the site if the user is a farmer. Farmers can only access the site after verifying the required information.
